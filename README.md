This repo contain three mini projects 
Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset
Objective:
Understand how to read, summarize, and visualize a dataset.
Dataset:
Iris Dataset (CSV format, available through seaborn or other open sources)
Instructions:
● Load the dataset using the pandas library.
● Display dataset structure using .shape, .columns, and .head().
● Create basic visualizations:
○ Scatter plot to analyze relationships between variables.
○ Histogram to examine data distribution.
○ Box plot to detect outliers and spread of values.
● Use matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
Skills:
● Data loading and inspection using pandas
● Basic data summarization
● Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn


Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Customers)
Objective:
Identify customers who are likely to leave the bank.
Dataset:
Churn Modelling Dataset
Instructions:
● Clean and prepare the dataset.
● Encode categorical features such as geography and gender.
● Train a classification model.
● Analyze feature importance to understand what influences churn.
Skills:
● Categorical data encoding (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)
● Supervised classification modeling
● Understanding and interpreting feature importance




Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction
Objective:
Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer.
Dataset:
Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
Instructions:
● Perform basic data exploration on features such as age, job, and marital status.
● Train a Logistic Regression or Decision Tree classifier.
● Analyze the results to identify which customer groups are more likely to accept the offer.
Skills:
● Data exploration and visualization
● Classification modeling
● Business insight extraction from data
