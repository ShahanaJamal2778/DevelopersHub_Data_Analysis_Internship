📊 Mini Data Science Projects Repository

This repository contains three mini data science projects focused on data exploration, visualization, and supervised machine learning. Each project uses real-world datasets and demonstrates core data analysis and modeling skills using Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

📁 Projects Overview
✅ Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

Objective
Understand how to load, inspect, summarize, and visualize a dataset using Python.

Dataset

Iris Dataset (CSV format)

Available via seaborn or other open data sources

Key Steps

Load dataset using pandas

Inspect dataset structure using:

.shape

.columns

.head()

Create visualizations:

Scatter Plot (to analyze relationships)

Histogram (to examine data distribution)

Box Plot (to detect outliers and data spread)

Tools & Libraries

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

Skills Gained

Data loading and inspection
